A repo for team Ladybugaga's contribution to Capgemini's GDSC-6: the Biodiversity Buzz.

## Contributing

To start developing, install the package in editable mode using Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

> It is highly recommended to configure poetry to create virtualenvs inside each project folder by executing `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`

It is also recommended to install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pre-commit install
```
